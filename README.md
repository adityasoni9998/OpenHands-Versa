Welcome to OpenHands-Versa. More details will be posted here soon.

## OpenHands original README
OpenHands (formerly OpenDevin), is a platform for software development agents powered by AI.

OpenHands agents can do anything a human developer can: modify code, run commands, browse the web,
call APIs, and yes‚Äîeven copy code snippets from StackOverflow.

Learn more at [docs.all-hands.dev](https://docs.all-hands.dev), or jump to the [Quick Start](#-quick-start).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using OpenHands for work? We'd love to chat! Fill out
> [this short form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSet3VbGaz8z32gW9Wm-Grl4jpt5WgMXPgJ4EDPVmCETCBpJtQ/viewform)
> to join our Design Partner program, where you'll get early access to commercial features and the opportunity to provide input on our product roadmap.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

The easiest way to run OpenHands is in Docker.
See the [Running OpenHands](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/installation) guide for
system requirements and more information.

```bash
docker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.28-nikolaik

docker run -it --rm --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.28-nikolaik \
    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.openhands-state:/.openhands-state \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name openhands-app \
    docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.28
```

You'll find OpenHands running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

Finally, you'll need a model provider and API key.
[Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/api) (`anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`)
works best, but you have [many options](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/llms).

---

You can also [connect OpenHands to your local filesystem](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/runtimes#connecting-to-your-filesystem),
run OpenHands in a scriptable [headless mode](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/headless-mode),
interact with it via a [friendly CLI](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/cli-mode),
or run it on tagged issues with [a github action](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/github-action).

Visit [Running OpenHands](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/installation) for more information and setup instructions.

> [!CAUTION]
> OpenHands is meant to be run by a single user on their local workstation.
> It is not appropriate for multi-tenant deployments where multiple users share the same instance. There is no built-in isolation or scalability.
>
> If you're interested in running OpenHands in a multi-tenant environment, please
> [get in touch with us](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSet3VbGaz8z32gW9Wm-Grl4jpt5WgMXPgJ4EDPVmCETCBpJtQ/viewform)
> for advanced deployment options.
